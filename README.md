## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sudeeppp-Mishra/VHDL-101.git
   ```
2. Open your preferred VHDL simulator (e.g., GHDL, Xilinx ISE, or ModelSim).
3. Compile the VHDL design and the corresponding testbench.
4. Run the simulation to verify the behavior of each design.
